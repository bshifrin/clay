Below are some resources for getting started with Clay. To get started with a simple Clay instance you can [check out the starter repo](https://github.com/clay/clay-starter). If you see a phrase you don't recognize then check the [Glossary](/docs/glossary).

If there'a anything not covered in these docs you explicitly want to see [then file an issue](https://github.com/clay/clay/issues) and we'll get on it.

## Data Structures

- [Components](/docs/components): the backbone of Clay. Almost everything is a component!
- [Pages](/docs/pages): contains references to components
- [Layouts](/docs/layouts): similar to components, but instances are meant to be shared across pages
- [Uris](/docs/uris): a mapper from public urls to Clay uris
- [Lists](/docs/lists): a store for simple JSON objects that you can store data easily for components to reference
- [Users](/docs/users): the users of Clay who make the content
