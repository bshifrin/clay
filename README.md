# Clay

Clay is an open-source CMS created by [New York Media](http://mediakit.nymag.com/) powering [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com), [Vulture](http://www.vulture.com), [The Cut](https://www.thecut.com), [Grub Street](http://www.grubstreet.com) and [Slate](https://slate.com/). 

Clay is comprised of modules available on npm, but the core system is comprised of [Kiln](https://claycms.gitbooks.io/kiln/), the editing interface, and [Amphora](https://claycms.gitbook.io/amphora), the REST API. For more information on the two modules please see documentation on each. The documentation in this space is meant to explain core concepts of Clay, but for a deeper technical dive you can explore the documentation for each of the modules themselves.
